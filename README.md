# AltimetrikGameFinderApp #
## Game Finder is an app to find games and learn more about them. 
### It's an Alimetrik Front-End Bootcamp project.

This App is part of the Bootcamp "Become a Front End Developer!" from [Altimetrik](https://altimetrik.com). Thanks to this practice I am making use of the theoretical concepts learned from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What is Game Finder?
Find your next favorite game! Game Finder app has a list of more than 500.000 games with all their characteristics: images and videos, platforms where you can play them, developers and much more. You can perform searches and soon also add your favorites to a personalized list.
Stay close for new features!
