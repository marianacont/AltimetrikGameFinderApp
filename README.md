# AltimetrikGameFinderApp
## Game Finder is an app to find games and learn more about them. 
### It's an Alimetrik Front-End Bootcamp project.

This App is part of the Bootcamp "Become a Front End Developer!" from Altimetrik. Thanks to this practice I am making use of the theoretical concepts learned from HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Game Finder includes:
* log in
* list of games (using the rawg.io web API)
* search for games
* last searches list
* toggle between light and dark mode
* view the game list in three or one column
* responsive design
